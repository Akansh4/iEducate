          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within
          a structured institutional framework, such as public schools,
          following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured
          approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while
          informal education entails unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into
          levels, including early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications
          focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and
          student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science
          education, language education, and physical education. Additionally,
          the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of
          educated individuals and the academic field studying educational
          phenomena.

          Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of
          instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform
          tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms,
          step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or
          more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level
          programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than
          machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing
          unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several
          different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
          details of programming languages and generic code libraries,
          specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
